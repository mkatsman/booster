Initial assignment https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/README.md
I creaded the my directory and put all my implementation in there,
leaving the initial implementation outside.
I added MyItem class, which extends an Item and adds a new fieldcalled  type.
Created an ItemProcessor interface and the concrete class for each type, which implements the updateQuality method.
ItemProcessorFactory producess a processor for each item type.
The default type is GENERAL.
The default test is in MyGuildedRoseTest class.
